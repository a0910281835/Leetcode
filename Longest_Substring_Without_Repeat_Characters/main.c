/*
Taget : Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

example 1
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

example 2
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

example 3
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


Condtion : Can use to Calculate O(f(N))


    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
